# Qix - Phaser 3 Typescript Implementation

I enjoyed this game in my childhood and wanted to learn how to create a game for a browser. This is a work in progress.

## Install

```
npm install
```
## Run Dev

```
npm run dev
```

* This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.
* Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.
* Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser

## Deploy

```
npm run deploy
```
